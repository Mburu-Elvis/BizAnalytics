# Real-Time Distributed Analytics Platform for Small Businesses

## Description

Build a real-time analytics SaaS platform that aggregates, processes, and visualizes business data (e.g., sales, customer interactions, inventory) across multiple locations for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs).

## Core Features

**1. Data Ingestion:**  

Support multiple input sources (e.g., POS systems, e-commerce platforms, and CSV uploads).
Real-time ingestion pipeline using Kafka or RabbitMQ.

```json
    {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "transactionId": {"type": "string"},
            "storeId": {"type": "string"},
            "timestamp": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"},
            "items": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                "itemId": {"type": "string"},
                "quantity": {"type": "integer"},
                "price": {"type": "number"}
                },
                "required": ["itemId", "quantity", "price"]
            }
            },
            "totalAmount": {"type": "number"},
            "paymentMethod": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "required": ["transactionId", "storeId", "timestamp", "items", "totalAmount", "paymentMethod"]
    }
```

**2. Data Processing:**

Stream processing with tools like Apache Flink or Spark Streaming to calculate key metrics:
    Sales trends, inventory alerts, and customer behavior patterns.
Support for real-time and batch processing.

**3. Data Storage:**

Implement database sharding for scalability (e.g., horizontal partitioning in PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
Use data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery for complex analytics queries.

**4. Caching Layer:**

Optimize frequent queries with Redis or Memcached for low-latency responses.
Cache pre-aggregated analytics results to serve dashboards quickly.

**5. Real-Time Notifications:**

Push notifications for inventory shortages, sales milestones, or anomalies using WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE).

**6. Scalability:**

Use microservices to handle ingestion, processing, and querying separately.
Enable auto-scaling with Kubernetes (horizontal pod scaling).

**7. User Management:**

Multi-tenant architecture: Isolate data for different businesses.
Role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. store manager).

**8. Monitoring and Observability:**

Track pipeline performance with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger or OpenTelemetry.

**9. Secure APIs:**

Use OAuth2 for secure access.
Rate limiting with tools like Kong or Nginx.

**10. Interactive Dashboards:**

Build frontend with React (or another modern framework).
Allow customizable data views (e.g., sales by region, daily performance).
